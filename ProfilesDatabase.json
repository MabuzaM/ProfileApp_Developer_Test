    "Description": "I am a passionate, hardworking, patient, reliable man who has grown an interest in the creation of applications and computer software. I possess programming skills in Visual Basic.Net, PHP, and JavaScript. More so, I also have experience with many other web technologies such as CSS3, Bootstrap, HTML5, Ajax, JQuery and many more. Currently in my third year of study towards a Degree in Software Engineering I am looking forward to expanding my skills and knowledge in the Tech Industry. My other qualifications include B-Tech Degree in Human Resource Development, Diploma in Office Management and Technology, Post Graduate Diploma in Science and Technology Education. I have experience in teaching computer science at a secondary school, working in an office environment as a client liaison officer. I am eagerly looking forward to working for such an established company as Tech Oasis Systems. I enjoyed doing this test as it helped open my eyes to see and experience the great features endowed in asp.net core. Really enjoyed working on C# after a long time as was more biased towards the PHP technologies. Looking forward to creating more amazing magic with using the Microsoft Technology Stack as a part of Tech Oasis Team of Developers. Thank you.",
